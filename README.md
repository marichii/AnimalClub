# AnimalClub
Hello! Welcome to AnimalClub. <br>
AnimalClub is a program that creates a friendly combat simulation. 
To start, select the mode you want to play (Against CPU or with a friend). From there, choose the character you want to play, and the items you want to equip. These creatures have different base stats, and items boost or negate stats. Along with that, environments also boost certain creatures stats. After selection is set, a random environment is generated and items bring you to battle based on stats. <br>
From there, you either win or lose.
